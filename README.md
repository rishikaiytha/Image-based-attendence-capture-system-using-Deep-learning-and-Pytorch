# Image-based-attendence-capture-system-using-Deep-learning-and-Pytorch
The project described here takes in a test image and predict if it matched with any of the trained image set. I have used deep learning and Pytorch and programmed it in the Python language.

I have two part submission here 
   Part 01: The program which is an Image based attendence capturing system 
   Part 02: A write up about how recurrent neural network such as LSTM and GRU based models can be used in Autonomous             Vehicles
   
   INSTRUCTION:
   1. Read the file "Part-01 Interview" for details regarding part 1  of the  submission
   2. For Part-02 of the assignment, Open the file names "Part-02 Interview"
