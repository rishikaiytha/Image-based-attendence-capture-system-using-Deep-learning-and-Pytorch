# Image-based-attendence-capture-system-using-Deep-learning-and-Pytorch
The project described here takes in a test image and predict if it matched with any of the trained image set. I have used deep learning and Pytorch and programmed it in the Python language.
I have two part submission here 
   Part A: The program which is an Image based attendence capturing system 
   Part B: A write up about how recurrent neural network such as LSTM and GRU based models can be used in Autonomous Vehicles
